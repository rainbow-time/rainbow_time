A set of plugins and scripts for deluge to automate downloading torrents based on IMDB and TVDB queues.

Like FlexGet but simplified and more closely integrated with Deluge.

Supports downloading whole series at once. Will automatically download first episodes and download later episodes in turn.

Will consistently rename and move files as they get downloaded using FileBot application.
